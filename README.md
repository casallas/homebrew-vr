Homebrew-VR
==============
These are Virtual Reality formulae for Homebrew. They include vr-juggler, vr-jugglua and
an older version of osg (osg28, needed for vr-jugglua).

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap jscasallas/vr` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install jscasallas/vr/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/jscasallas/homebrew-vr/master/<formula>.rb
```
